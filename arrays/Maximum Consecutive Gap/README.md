Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form. Try to solve it in linear time/space. Example :
Input : [1, 10, 5]
Output : 5 
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
You may assume that all the elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
You may also assume that the difference will not overflow.
