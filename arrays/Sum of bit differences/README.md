Write a program to find the sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements n. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is a count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y. For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 ( first and last bits differ in two numbers).

Input: The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of the test case will contain an array of elements n.
Output: The sum of bit differences of all pairs that can be formed by given array.
Constraints:

1 <=T<= 100

1 <=N<= 10

1 <=a[i]<= 10
Example:

Input:

2
2 
1 2
3 
1 3 5

Output:

4
8
