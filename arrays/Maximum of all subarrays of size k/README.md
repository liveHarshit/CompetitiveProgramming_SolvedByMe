Given an array A and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array and the size of subarray K. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print the maximum for every subarray of size k.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
1 ≤ K ≤ N
0 ≤ A[i] <= 107

Example:
Input:
2
9 3
1 2 3 1 4 5 2 3 6
10 4
8 5 10 7 9 4 15 12 90 13

Output:
3 3 4 5 5 5 6
10 10 10 15 15 90 90

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Starting from first subarray of size k = 3, we have 3 as maximum. Moving the window forward, maximum element are as 3, 4, 5, 5, 5 and 6.
