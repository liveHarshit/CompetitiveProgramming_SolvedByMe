Minimize the absolute difference
Given three sorted arrays A, B and Cof not necessarily same sizes. Calculate the minimum absolute difference between the maximum and minimum number from the triplet a, b, c such that a, b, c belongs arrays A, B, C respectively. i.e. minimize | max(a,b,c) - min(a,b,c) |. Example : Input:
A : [ 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 ]
B : [ 6, 9, 15 ]
C : [ 2, 3, 6, 6 ]
Output:
1
Explanation: We get the minimum difference for a=5, b=6, c=6 as | max(a,b,c) - min(a,b,c) | = |6-5| = 1.
