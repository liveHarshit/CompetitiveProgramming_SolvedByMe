Length of Longest Subsequence
Given an array of integers, A of length N, find the length of longest subsequence which is first increasing then decreasing. Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains an integer array, A.
Output Format:
Return an integer representing the answer as described in the problem statement.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 3000
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
Example:
Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 1]

Output 1:
    3

Explanation 1:
    [1, 2, 1] is the longest subsequence.

Input 2:
    [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Output 2:
    6

Explanation 2:
    [1 2 10 4 2 1] is the longest subsequence.
